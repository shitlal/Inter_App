                        <h4 align="justify">1. Which are considered as eligible lending institutions under the Scheme?</h4>
                        <p align="justify">All Scheduled Commercial Banks (either PSU, Private or Foreign Banks), Regional Rural Banks (categorised under &quot;Sustainable Viability&quot;), or such of those institutions as may be directed by GOI can avail of guarantee cover in respect of their eligible credit facilities under the Scheme. National Small Industries Corporation Ltd (NSIC) and North Eastern Development Finance Corporation Ltd (NEDFi) have been included as eligible institutions. </p>
                        <h4 align="justify" >2. Can a Private sector bank or a foreign bank be eligible for guarantee cover? </h4>
                        <p align="justify">Yes, provided it is a commercial bank listed in the II Schedule to the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1949. </p>
                        <h4 align="justify" >3. Is Regional Rural Bank eligible for guarantee cover? </h4>
                        <p align="justify">Yes. But only those Regional Rural Banks, which have been classified by NABARD under the category - 'Sustainable Viability'. As of now, there are 55 such RRBs eligible to become MLIs to avail of guarantee facility. </p>
                        <h4 align="justify" >4. Whether SFCs, Twin Function IDCs, Scheduled Co-operative Banks, Urban Co-operative Banks and NBFCs are eligible lending institutions for availing guarantee cover under the CGFSI? </h4>
                        <p align="justify">No. These are not eligible institutions. </p>
                        <h4 align="justify" >5. When can the eligible lending institutions apply for guarantee cover in respect of eligible credit facilities under the Scheme? </h4>
                        <p align="justify">The eligible lending institutions are required to enter into an 'one time' agreement with CGTMSE for becoming Member Lending Institutions (MLIs) of the Trust. MLIs can then apply for guarantee cover in respect of any eligible credit facility sanctioned to any eligible borrower. MLIs should give importance to the viability of the project. </p>
                        <h4 align="justify" >6. Whether the Trust will re-appraise the proposals sanctioned by the lenders for approving guarantee cover? </h4>
                        <p align="justify">Lenders are expected to support only viable proposals using their commercial discretion and due diligence. CGTMSE will have full trust in their credit evaluation. The Trust will not re-evaluate the proposals sanctioned by lenders. If the proposals satisfy the basic norms laid down under the scheme, the Trust will extend guarantee cover. </p>
                        <h4 align="justify" >7. What is the facility provided to an MLI desiring to know about the details of accounts covered under guarantee cover by CGTMSE? </h4>
                        <p align="justify">Our website www.creditguarantee.org.in or www.CGTMSE.org.in has 'Reports &amp; Queries' module to enable the MLIs to generate standard reports or structured queries through the sub-module 'Query Builder'. An MLI can log on to the website-member page, using member-ID allotted and generate the reports desired by it. </p>

                        <h4 align="justify" >&nbsp;</h4>
                        <h4 align="justify" >1. Which type of borrowers can be covered under the Scheme? </h4>
                        <p align="justify">New and existing SSI units engaged in manufacturing activity or in information technology (IT) and software industry. </p>
                        <h4 align="justify" >2. Whether borrowers from all service sector enterprises are eligible under the Scheme? </h4>
                        <p align="justify">As of now, IT enabled service sector and software industry are only eligible for the guarantee. </p>
                        <h4 align="justify" >3. Whether loans given to Small Road Transport Operators are eligible for coverage under the Scheme? </h4>
                        <p align="justify">No. Transport loans are not eligible for guarantee cover. </p>
                        <h4 align="justify" >4. Is it compulsory for the borrower to obtain Income Tax Permanent Account Number [IT-PAN] to be an eligible borrower? </h4>
                        <p align="justify">Under the Guarantee Scheme, a borrower is required to obtain IT PAN number prior to availing of credit facility from the eligible lending institution. Also it is a mandatory requirement under section 139A(5) read with section 272(C) of the I.T Act 1961 to indicate IT PAN on all tax documents which include returns, challans, appeals, etc. However, in respect of loans up to Rs. 10 lakh, CGTMSE is presently not insisting that the IT PAN be obtained at the time of availing of the guarantee cover. Nevertheless, the MLIs have been advised to inform their borrowers to apply for IT PAN number. </p>
                        <h4 align="justify" >5. Is guarantee benefit available to existing units of a lending institution which has become a MLI of CGTMSE? </h4>
                        <p align="justify">In case of existing units, additional credit facilities in the form of term loan or renewal of working capital facilities be covered as and when the facilities are extended, provided all the facilities are collateral-free. Part of the credit facility with collateral and part of the facility without collateral for guarantee cover would not be entertained. </p>
                        <h4 align="justify" >6. Is it necessary that a borrower to be eligible should obtain all the required credit facilities from a single institution? </h4>
                        <p align="justify">All credit facilities should be made available from a single institution. Since the quantum of credit facilities is less, it is expected that a single lender extends investment credit, working capital and any incremental working capital required by the SSI unit. However, where an SSI unit, which has already been assisted by a state level institution, is extended collateral free credit by MLI of the Trust for expansion /modernisation / working capital assistance, such credit facilities would be covered under the credit guarantee scheme. </p>
                        <p align="right"><a href="#Top" class="black11link">Back to Top</a></p>
                        <h2 align="justify">C. Credit facilities &amp; parameters <a name="3"></a></h2>
                        <h4 align="justify" >&nbsp;</h4>
                        <h4 align="justify" >1. What is quantum of credit facility that can be covered under the Scheme? </h4>
                        <p align="justify">Term loan and / or working capital facilities over Rs.5 lakh and up to Rs.25 lakh per eligible borrower are covered under the guarantee scheme provided they are extended purely on the project viability, and ofcourse, without collateral security. </p>
                        <h4 align="justify" >2. Can a credit facility of over Rs. 25 lakh be covered under the Scheme? </h4>
                        <p align="justify">Yes, provided that the entire credit facility is extended without any collateral security and it is otherwise eligible for a guarantee cover under the Scheme. The guarantee cover available will be restricted to credit of Rs. 25 lakh. even though credit extended is more than Rs. 25 lakh to an eligible borrower. In other words, maximum of credit risk borne by CGTMSE is restricted to Rs.18.75 lakh being 75% of Rs.25 lakh. </p>
                        <h4 align="justify" >3. What would be the guarantee / service fee that would be payable by the member-lending institution on credit facility sanctioned in excess of Rs. 25 lakh? </h4>
                        <p align="justify">The guarantee fee payable @2.5% would be on the loan agreed to be covered by the Trust. In this case, maximum of Rs. 25 lakh would be extended guarantee cover even though the sanctioned amount exceeds Rs. 25 lakh. Similarly, the service fee would be payable @1% on the outstanding amount subject to a ceiling of Rs. 25 lakh. </p>
                        <h4 align="justify" >4. Can term loan or working capital facility alone be extended by an eligible lender and still be covered under the guarantee scheme? </h4>
                        <p align="justify">Yes, a lender can extend either term loan or working capital facility alone and still be eligible for a guarantee cover if it meets the other eligibility parameters. Needless to say, the credit facility extended to a borrower should be without any collateral security. </p>
                        <h4 align="justify" >5. Can a credit facility extended to a borrower against a collateral security be covered under the Guarantee Scheme, if the lending institution relinquishes its rights on the collateral security? </h4>
                        <p align="justify">Yes, provided the lending institution relinquishes its rights on the collateral assets and releases the same in favour of the borrower prior to seeking guarantee cover and provided it conforms to the other norms of the Scheme. </p>
                        <h4 align="justify" >6. Is there any ceiling in respect of interest to be levied on the credit facility advanced to the borrower if the same is to be covered under the Scheme? </h4>
                        <p align="justify">The lender has to follow the guidelines issued by RBI regarding charging of interest on the credit. However, the rate of interest shall not exceed 3% over and above Prime Lending Rate (PLR) of the lender. This is exclusive of the fee payable to the Trust. </p>
                        <h4 align="justify" >7. The scheme doesn't cover non-fund based limits. What if the Non-fund-based limits crystalise into fund-based? </h4>
                        <p align="justify">Problem faced by SSIs is mainly non-availability of fund-based facilities. The scheme covers fund-based limits sanctioned to the borrower. Nevertheless, the amount of non-fund based facility getting converted into fund based facility will naturally get debited to cash credit account. So long as the total outstanding in the working capital account is within the overall fund based limit sanctioned at the time of seeking guarantee, the lender can prefer the claim inclusive of such 'non-fund based facilities' which crystalised into 'fund-based facilities'. </p>
                        <h4 align="justify" >8. Is it possible to cover credit facilities which have already become NPA? </h4>
                        <p align="justify">The credit facility that has already become NPA cannot be covered under the Scheme. </p>
                        <p align="right"><a href="#Top" class="black11link">Back to Top</a></p>
                        <h2 align="justify">D. Primary Security vis-a-vis Collateral security/personal vis-&agrave;-vis third party guarantee</h2>
                        <h4 align="justify" >&nbsp;</h4>
                        <h4 align="justify" >1. What is the difference between primary security and collateral security? </h4>
                        <p align="justify">Primary security is the asset created out of the credit facility extended to the borrower and / or which are directly associated with the business / project of the borrower for which the credit facility has been extended. Collateral security is any other security offered for the said loan. For example, hypothecation of jewellery, mortgage of house, etc. </p>
                        <h4 align="justify" >2. Whether the personal guarantee of the promoters can be obtained for sanctioning credit facility? </h4>
                        <p align="justify">Yes. Personal guarantee of the promoters can be obtained. </p>
                        <h4 align="justify" >3. Under the Scheme, any third party guarantee obtained for the credit facilities will make them ineligible for guarantee cover. What is third party guarantee? </h4>
                        <p align="justify">Personal guarantee of the borrower Promoters, Partners etc. is not a third party guarantee. Whereas if a borrower is asked to furnish guarantee of any other person / corporate not connected with the project, it would be considered as third party guarantee. </p>

                        <h4 align="justify" >1. Whether the incidence of guarantee fee and annual service fee be passed on by the lender to the borrower? </h4>
                        <p align="justify">Yes. </p>
                        <h4 align="justify" >2. Whether the rates of guarantee fee and annual service fee can be varied after the commencement of guarantee cover? </h4>
                        <p align="justify">Guarantee fee and service fee rates will not be changed with retrospective effect. Since the guarantee fee is payable only once at the time of seeking guarantee cover, so any change in rate will have only prospective effect on the future proposals to be covered under the Scheme. As regards annual service fee that is payable on the outstanding credit facilities as on March 31, the prevailing rate at that time will apply. Currently, the rate of service fee is 1%. </p>
                        <h4 align="justify" >3. Is service fee payable even after lodgment of claim? </h4>
                        <p align="justify">Service fee is not payable after settlement of 75% of the guaranteed amount. However, no claim can be lodged before the expiry of the initial lock-in period of 24 months from the date of the guarantee cover or the date of last disbursement, whichever is later. </p>
                        <h4 align="justify" >4. What would be the guarantee / service fee that would be payable by the member-lending institution on credit facility sanctioned in excess of Rs. 25 lakh? </h4>
                        <p align="justify">The guarantee fee payable @2.5% would be on the loan agreed to be covered by the Trust. In this case, maximum of Rs. 25 lakh would be extended guarantee cover even though the sanctioned amount exceeds Rs. 25 lakh. Similarly, the service fee would be payable @1% on the outstanding amount subject to a ceiling of Rs. 25 lakh. </p>
                        <h4 align="justify" >5. How is the service fee payable for the first year? </h4>
                        <p align="justify">For the first year of coverage of each borrower unit, the service fee is worked out on pro-rata basis i.e. 1% of fee charged for the period (no. of days) of outstanding, starting from the date of commencement of the guarantee cover till March 31. For calculation of annual service fee, number of days in a year is taken as 365. For subsequent years, service fee of 1% is charged for the whole year, as the credit facility, remaining outstanding in the borrowal account for the entire year. </p>
                        <h4 align="justify" >6. In a hypothetical case, if a lender gives working capital limit of Rs.10 lakh in the first year, seeks guarantee cover, and enhances the limit in the second year to Rs.15 lakh, what would be the treatment for payment of guarantee fee and guarantee cover? </h4>
                        <p align="justify">One time guarantee fee of 2.5% is payable on the limit sanctioned / and on the sub sequent incremental enhancements. Therefore, in the first year the guarantee fee shall be paid by the lender at 2.5% on the limit of Rs.10 lakh sanctioned. On any further enhancement, guarantee fee is payable on the incremental enhancement i.e. in the hypothetical case, on Rs.5 lakh. As regards guarantee cover is concerned, guarantee will be available for a block of 5 years where working capital alone is given. In the hypothetical case, the guarantee cover is available for a period of 5 years from the date of first limit sanctioned, irrespective of further enhancement during the said block of 5 years. Thereafter, the guarantee is to be renewed for another block of 5 years. </p>

                        <h4 align="justify" >1. What is the guarantee cap available to the lender per eligible borrower? </h4>
                        <p align="justify">The Trust shares the credit risk with the lender in the ratio of 3:1. In other words, credit risk borne by CGTMSE is 75% of maximum eligible credit facility of Rs.25 lakh extended by the lender. Thus, the guarantee cap available to the lender per eligible borrower is Rs.18.75 lakh. </p>
                        <h4 align="justify" >2. When should the lender apply for the guarantee cover? </h4>
                        <p align="justify">The eligible lending institution can apply for guarantee cover in respect of credit proposals sanctioned in the quarter April-June, July-September, October-December and January-March prior to expiry of the following quarter viz. July-September, October-December, January-March and April-June respectively. However, MLIs are expected to continue filing applications with the Trust for guarantee cover as soon as they sanction eligible credit facilities. </p>
                        <h4 align="justify" >3. When will the guarantee cover commence for the eligible credit facility? </h4>
                        <p align="justify">The guarantee cover will commence from the date of payment of guarantee fee (2.5% of the amount of credit facility sanctioned) by the lender. Date of payment will be the date on which the fee is credited to the Trust's A/c. </p>
                        <h4 align="justify" >4. How long the guarantee cover is available for credit facilities extended to a particular borrower? </h4>
                        <p align="justify">Guarantee will commence from the date of payment of guarantee fee and shall run through the agreed tenure of the term loan / composite loans. Where working capital facilities alone are extended to eligible borrowers, it would be for a period of 5 years or block of 5 years on renewal of the guarantee cover. Provided, MLI pays the annual service fee of 1% on the outstanding credit as on march 31, latest by May 31 every year. </p>
                        <h4 align="justify" >5. Whether the interest on term loan and other charges can also be guaranteed by the Trust? </h4>
                        <p align="justify">In case of default by the borrower subject to overall guarantee cap amount, the liability of the Trust shall be in respect of credit facility as follows: - </p>
                        i.&nbsp;Term Loan
                        <p align="justify">Defaulted principal amount </p>
                        ii.&nbsp;Working capital facility
                        <p align="justify">Outstanding working capital advance (inclusive of interest) </p>
                        <p align="justify">Other charges such as interest on principal amount of term loan, penal interest, commitment charge, service charge or any other levies / expenses shall not qualify for the guarantee cover. </p>
                        <h4 align="justify" >6. Whether the credit facility for rehabilitation / nursing of the sick unit can also be eligible for guarantee under the Scheme? </h4>
                        <p align="justify">The eligible borrower unit which has been covered under the Scheme and subsequently becomes sick due to factors beyond the control of the management, the assistance / credit for rehabilitation extended by the lender could also be covered under the Scheme provided the overall assistance is within the credit cap of Rs.25 lakh, for such extended period of guarantee and on such terms as may be decided by the Trust. </p>
                        <h4 align="justify" >7. What is the tenure of the cover for credit relating to working capital? </h4>
                        <p align="justify">The tenure for coverage of working capital facilities is 5 years, where working capital alone is covered under the scheme. In case term credit and working capital both are covered under the scheme, the tenure relating to working capital facility would match the normal repayment period of term credit. The reason for keeping a limit of 5 years wherever working capital alone are covered are that the period for which the same are extended by the lending institutions are not time bound. The same are reviewed periodically for increase/ decrease in the limit sanctioned, and are expected to continue for a time frame much longer than 5 years. CGTMSE welcomes any renewal of guarantee cover beyond 5 years on a payment of guarantee fee @ 2.5% or such rate, as may be prescribed from time to time. </p>
                        <h4 align="justify" >8. Whether the guarantee will continue to be available in respect of a particular borrower unit if there is change in management of that borrower during the period the guarantee is in force? </h4>
                        <p align="justify">If the new promoters / management meets / satisfy the norms of the eligible borrower viz. maximum credit availed and outstanding, SSI status etc., and continues to perform the existing activities of borrower or undertakes the new activities which otherwise are eligible under the Scheme for guarantee then the lender can continue such borrower with existing liabilities under the scheme of guarantee. However, if the new promoter / management do not satisfy any of the norms of the Scheme, the guarantee in respect of the credit facility shall be deemed to be terminated from the date of said transfer or assignment. </p>
                        <h4 align="justify" >9. Under what circumstances the guarantee cover obtained by the lender in respect of particular borrower will lapse? </h4>
                        <p align="justify">The guarantee cover given by the Trust to the lender in respect of credit facility to a particular borrower will lapse if </p>
                        <p align="justify">i. it is subsequently brought to the knowledge of the Trust that the lender has obtained collateral / third party guarantee from the borrower while sanctioning the particular credit facility which has been covered under the guarantee, </p>
                        <p align="justify">ii. it is subsequently gathered that the lender has advanced second / subsequent credit facility to the borrower with collateral / third party guarantee and extended the scope of collateral / third party guarantee to the existing credit facility for which guarantee cover has been obtained from the Trust, </p>
                        <p align="justify">iii. annual service charge is not paid to the Trust by the specified period or such extended time limit as may be granted by the Trust, </p>
                        <p align="justify">iv. there is change in the management of the borrower which has not been brought to the notice of the Trust, and </p>

                        <h4 align="justify" >10. When can the lender invoke the guarantee given by the Trust in respect of credit facility advanced by it to the eligible borrower? </h4>
                        <p align="justify">The lender shall prefer a claim on the defaulted account on recall of loan and initiation of recovery proceedings by filing a suit in the Civil Court . The lender can, however, invoke the guarantee given by the Trust only after the lock-in period of 24 months either from the date of last disbursement of credit to the borrower or from the date of the guarantee cover coming into force in respect of the particular credit facility, whichever is later. </p>
                        <h4 align="justify" >11. How the claim of lender will be settled by the Trust in respect of defaulting account? </h4>
                        <p align="justify">After satisfying itself about the procedural aspects met by the lender, regarding lodgement / preferment of claim for guarantee, the Trust will honour 75% of the guaranteed portion of the outstanding in default, subject to maximum of 75% of the guaranteed cap amount. The balance 25% shall be paid on conclusion of the recovery proceedings. </p>
                        <h4 align="justify" >12. Whether guarantee cover is available to the second term loan sanctioned after 2/3 years of the first term loan? Whether the cash credit will continue to be covered under the scheme up to repayment of the 2nd term loan? </h4>
                        <p align="justify">Where working capital is sanctioned along with the term loan facility, the tenure of such working capital facility shall be co-terminus with that of term loan facility and shall run concurrently with the scheduled repayment period of the term loan facility. Subsequent to the repayment of the term loan along with which working capital was sanctioned, the guarantee cover in respect of working capital can be got renewed for a period of 5 years by paying 2.5% of the sanctioned working capital facility or the renewal of working capital may also be clubbed with the second term loan facility so that both are sanctioned together, thus getting guarantee cover for both the facilities for a period equal to the repayment period of second term loan, on payment of 2.5% of the sanctioned (term loan + working capital) account. </p>
                        <h4 align="justify" >13. Whether the responsibility to recover the defaulted credit is taken over by the Trust after the settlement of claim (75% of the guaranteed amount) in respect of particular borrower account? </h4>
                        <p align="justify">The lender continues to remain responsible to take all efforts in recovery of credit advanced to the borrower who had defaulted, even after the initial settlement of the claim by the Trust. </p>
                        <h4 align="justify" >14. Where the credit facilities are covered under ECGC, is it possible to avail guarantee cover to the extent not covered by ECGC under CGTMSE guarantee scheme? </h4>
                        <p align="justify">Any credit facility which has been covered partially or fully under the Guarantee Scheme of any other Agency will not be eligible to be covered under the Credit Guarantee Scheme operated by the Trust. </p>

                        <p align="justify">Yes. The lending institution is, however, required to seek the consent of the Trust prior to going ahead with OTS. </p>
                        <h4 align="justify" >3. Lending Institution is required to obtain prior permission of the Trust for any OTS compromise with the borrowers. Will this not affect speedy recovery efforts of the Member Lending Institution? </h4>
                        <p align="justify">The Trust is not against any one-time settlements with the borrowers by the lending institutions. Since 75% of the credit advanced by the Lending Institution has been guaranteed by the Trust, it should be considered fair and transparent to seek prior permission of the Trust. Since communication between the Trust and the lending institutions can be established on line through internet, there should be no delay in getting approvals from the Trust for such compromise settlements. </p>

                        <p align="justify">The cardinal principles of the Scheme are as follows: </p>
                        <p align="justify">i. Only SSI units engaged in manufacturing activities and those in Information Technology related / Software industry are eligible to be covered under the Scheme. As far as service sector is concerned, units engaged in IT related / software industry alone are eligible to be covered under the Scheme. Other service sector activities are not eligible for coverage under the Scheme. </p>
                        <p align="justify">ii. All the credit facilities of the borrowing units should be from single lending institution. </p>
                        <p align="justify">iii. The entire credit facility has to be given without collateral and/or third party guarantee. Loans may be secured against the primary security which has been defined under the Scheme to include assets created out of the credit facility extended to the borrowers and / or which are directly associated with the business/project of the borrower for which the credit facility has been extended. Personal guarantee(s) of the promoters may be obtained to secure the loan. In those cases where MLIs have already obtained collateral security from the borrowing units to secure existing credit facilities, the collateral security needs to be released before covering under the Scheme any additional credit facility sanctioned to the same borrowing unit. </p>
                        <p align="justify">iv. The rate of interest charged to the unit should not exceed 3% above the Prime Lending Rate (PLR) of the lending institution. </p>
                        <p align="justify">v. The dues of the borrowing unit to the lending institution should not have become bad or doubtful of recovery as on date of issue of guarantee cover. </p>
                        <h4 align="justify" >2. How is this guarantee scheme operated by the Trust? </h4>
                        <p align="justify">The operations of this Scheme are fully computerized using B2B e-business concept to enable the Trust to deliver prompt service to the lenders. </p>
                        <h4 align="justify" >3. Explain the B2B concept? Its relevance to the operations of CGTMSE? </h4>
                        <p align="justify">B2B concept is business-to-business operations conducted through Internet between two or more business partners. </p>
                        <p align="justify">Each Operating Office of an MLI is allotted a member-id, user-id and password. The operating office concerned can log on to the website of CGTMSE by using this information and submit the applications online. In order to facilitate the operating office to send applications in batch mode, thin client software has been provided to these offices by CGTMSE. Using the thin client software, the operating office can first fill in the required information, as per the format provided, for each of the loan proposal and then upload all the applications, irrespective of number of such applications, at a time to CGTMSE website. CGTMSE picks the uploaded data from its MLIs every four hour from its website and process the applications. The guarantee cover is approved within a day's time and Operating Office of MLI is informed through mail about the status of the applications lodged with CGTMSE site. The Operating Office concerned is required to login to CGTMSE website and open the mail to see the status of the applications lodged by it. </p>
                        <p align="justify">As soon as the guarantee cover is approved, a Demand Advice is sent by CGTMSE by mail to the Operating Office concerned. On receipt of the Demand Advice, the requisite guarantee fee as indicated in the Demand Advice, is required to be remitted by the Operating Office to the Collecting Bank of CGTMSE. Guarantee fee is payable within 30 days from the date of first disbursement effected by the Operating Office of MLI to its borrower. Where loan has already been disbursed, the guarantee fee is payable within 30 days from the date of Demand Advice. While making the payment of guarantee fee, the Operating Office of MLI should also indicate the relevant application identification number (CGPAN) allotted by CGTMSE. </p>
                        <p align="justify">On receipt of the guarantee fee, the Guarantee Cover stands issued. </p>

                        <p align="justify">Before starting implementation of the Scheme, MLIs are required to give the names and addresses of the Zonal / Regional / Branch offices through which they would like to operate the Scheme. They are also required to furnish us names of a nodal officer and two other officers who will be operating the Scheme at each of the operating offices. On receipt of this information, Member ID and Passwords would be allotted by the Trust, after which it would be possible for MLIs to lodge applications for guarantee cover.

                        <h4 align="justify" >5. Can the SSI entrepreneurs / borrowers approach the Trust directly to seek guarantee for the credits sanctioned by the Banks? </h4>
                        <p align="justify">CGTMSE gives guarantee to its MLIs. Therefore, the SSI entrepreneurs / borrowers have to approach the Banks or financial institutions (who have already registered with the Trust as MLIs) with their viable proposals for their credit requirements. The List of MLIs of the Trust can be seen at CGTMSE's web-site at http://www.creditguarantee.org.in or www.CGTMSE.org.in </p>
                        <h4 align="justify" >6. Why CGTMSE would extend guarantee cover for credit above Rs.5 lakh only? </h4>
                        <p align="justify">As per RBI directive to banks, credit up to Rs.5 lakh extended to all SSI units is to be provided without collateral security. Keeping this in view, CGTMSE has modified the scheme to provide for guarantee cover to banks for credit extended b them to eligible borrowers for over Rs. 5 lakh and up to Rs.25 lakh. This modification comes into effect for all those credits sanctioned by MLIs to the eligible borrowers on or after February 1, 2003. </p>
                        <h4 align="justify" >7. Can a Bank / Institution seek single guarantee cover or lump sum guarantee cover for all the loans outstanding in respect of all the eligible SSI borrowers? </h4>
                        <p align="justify">Single guarantee cover or enblock guarantee cover for all outstanding loans is not permissible. Under the Scheme applications are required to be filed by the MLIs, individually, in respect of each of the borrower. The Scheme provides for coverage of only new loans / renewed working capital limits sanctioned to manufacturing units in the small scale industries sector or units in software / IT industry. The new credits sanctioned by MLIs in a quarter have to be covered under Guarantee Scheme as early as possible, in any case, not beyond the subsequent quarter. The applications are to be submitted by the identified branches, which have been allotted member Id, passwords by CGTMSE, using the internet connectivity either online or using ThinClient software for uploading applications in batch mode. </p>
                        <h4 align="justify" >8. Will payment of Guarantee Fee @ 2.5% on the whole outstanding SSI portfolio of the MLI, with loans up to Rs 25 lakh, is acceptable to CGTMSE? </h4>
                        <p align="justify">Under the Scheme applications are required to be filed by the Operating Offices of MLIs, individually, for each of the borrower for credit facilities extended. One time guarantee fee of 2.5% is payable by MLI on the term loans / working capital sanctioned to the eligible borrowers, and not on the outstanding amounts. However, annual service fee is payable on the outstanding amount. Guarantee fee @ 2.5% will be paid by the respective operating office of the MLIs on receipt of demand advice, intimating approval of guarantee. On receipt of payment in Trust's Bank A/c., guarantee will be issued against each of the borrower account. As regards service fee, it is levied for pro-rata period of outstanding from the date of guarantee issue date, for the first year. In subsequent years, service fee is payable @ 1% p.a. </p>
                        <h4 align="justify" >9. Does CGTMSE have branch offices in other cities in India ? </h4>
                        <p align="justify">CGTMSE does not have any branch office other than its Registered Office at Mumbai. Since the entire operations are online, CGTMSE is able to cater to the needs of its MLIs from Mumbai. </p>
